Average discount percentages vary significantly by category.
A few categories (e.g., electronics or accessories) offer above-average discounts.
2. 🧮 Product Distribution
.Certain categories dominate in terms of product count, suggesting market saturation.
.Less-populated categories may represent opportunity zones for new sellers.
. ⭐ Rating Distribution
